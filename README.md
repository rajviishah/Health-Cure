<h2>About the project</h2>

Healthcare is shaping up in front of our eyes with advances in digital healthcare technologies such as artificial Intelligence, 3D printing, robotics, nanotechnologies, etc. Artificial intelligent algorithms must be trained on population-representative information
to accomplish presentation levels essential for adaptable "accomplishment". Enlargement in health care data struggles with the lack of well-organized mechanisms for integrating and reconciling these data ahead of their current silos. However,
numerous frameworks and principles facilitate summation and accomplish adequate data quantity for AI.

<h2>7 Diseases Detection:</h2>

1. Covid-19 detection

2. Brain Tumour detection

3. Breast Cancer detection

4. Alzheimer detection

5. Diabetes detection

6. Pneumonia detection

7. Heart disease detection

<h2>Covid-19 detection:</h2>

- Used custom made CNN architecture for this detection.

- Accuracy achieved was around 93%.

<h2>Brain Tumor Detection:</h2>

- We have used VGG-16 for feature extractions and used a custom-made CNN and achieved an accuracy of 100% as we tested this only for 10 images.

<h2>Breast Cancer Detection:</h2>

- We have used Random Forest for this and achieved an accuracy of 91.81%.

<h2>Alzheimer Detection:</h2>

- Like Breast Cancer Detection we have used Random Forest algorithm and managed to achieve an accuracy of 73%.

<h2>Diabetes Detection:</h2>

- We have used Random Forest again and achieved an accuracy of 66%.

<h2>Pneumonia Detection:</h2>

- We have used CNN architecture for this and achieved an accuracy of 83%.

<h2>Heart Disease Detection:</h2>

- For detecting heart disease we have used XGBoost and achieved an accuracy of almost 87%.
